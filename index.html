                        software, which are in turn governed by code,
                        a result made possible by people learning to code and applying their skills to build such
                        software.</p>

                        another powered by software written by people who’ve learnt how to code. Code plays a pivotal
                        role in our daily lives,
                        most of us just haven’t realised the immense impact it has on how we live our lives yet.</p>
